thread locker is legal

wings intake blocker and high cata or kicker or flywheel (also being high is good)
if we want normal matches, try to be low (we need the threat of being able to descore triballs)
if we want to go for skills, doesnt matter
Mechanum or H-Drive might be really good for sliding inbetween triballs

the ideal bot is a wings on both sides, high elevation kicker (which also climbs and blocks) with intake that somehow goes to kicker when kicker is down

I think that the notebook is good enough for now

To do for next time
-
- Help with blocker
- Think about interviews
- Add backplate/pcb for wings
- Check up on catapult
- PCB for intake

To Do 
-
- PID and move to point
- Turn to degree
- CAD
- Notebook

Let eric do cata
Switch between henry with wings and intake and drivetrain and daniel with blocker
Ruben? maybe general parts

Double check intake
code auton and driver control
check stability and bracing

btw me and vince dont talk (driver and coder)
