Tomorrow we have the first tournament of our season.
Catapult was finished but yet to be attached to the bot, so we added it and tested how far it would shoot.

In addition, we made sure that our wings and intake work.
Our wings were set up the wrong way at first, so we had to switch around the solenoids.
Our intake worked fine.

We also made a simple autonamous program, but we didnt have a field and were unable to test it. To deal with this we created a varible called degreesPerInch which we would multiply the number of inches we would travel by when moving our motors. We also made a simpler one which could push 1 triball into any goal. 

Hopefully tomorrows tournament goes well!
