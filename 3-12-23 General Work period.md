<br>
Sometimes the wing will move up if the standoff twists, which prevents the standoff from locking when force applied, adding the string seems to help with this issue.
Should be fine with the string added on, more testing will be done, after which we can add pcb and copy it on the other side. <br>
<br>
Additionally, Daniel worked on the blocker. <br>

<br>
The second stage was added to make the blocker more of an umbrella, additionally, the blocker was braced better to withstand the force of triballs.<br>
After some improvements, the blocker should be ready to be added to the robot.
