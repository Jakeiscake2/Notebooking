Today was Stem Academy!!

Tournament Recap:
4th place in qualifications
Ended in Semi-finals with 2088C (3388N)
Lost to 210Z and 210T
Skills Score: 92 Total, 92 Driver, 0 Programming

Overall we did pretty well, but there still are some things to work on 

|Issue|Solution|
|-----|--------|
|Autonomous didn't work| Use a tournament manager next time|
|No driver practice| Work more efficiently and finish earlier|
|Wings were weak| Check pneuamtics for leaks and chaneg wing design|
|Catapult got stuck on elevation bar| Build bot lower or switch to a kicker/flywheel|
|Intake got stuck on catapult| Similar to last point, maybe use flexwheel intake instead|
|Overall organization (Messy Pit)| Have 1 person always at pit|
