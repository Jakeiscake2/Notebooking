Today Yulian made some preperations for tomorrows meeting. Other memebers were not here but communicated online<br>

Hoping to move the wings to the front of the bot where everything else will be located to make driving the bot easier.<br>
Wings have been challenging since there isn't much room at the front.<br>

There also isn't much room for the piston to be placed<br>

We have some new designs to hopefully replace the olds ones <br>

<br>
There are two changes to these wings, first the wings to stick out and second the locking mechanism is changed. <br>
Having the wings stick one hole out makes everything easier, easier maintence, easier building, etc. However, it does make the wings less stable. <br>
The locking mechanism has been changed from an over center mechanism to a single center standoff.  <br>
When the wing is pushed on, the standoff moves slightly horizontally, pushing into the pillow block instead of the piston. <br>
When the piston pulls the wing back, there is only vertical movement, allowing the wing to be pulled back. <br>

Both these changes need to be tested, but should allow us to move our wings to the front. <br>
