Order some tools off of robosource

We are rebuilding our entire bot - starting with our drivetrain

Drivetrain specs:
360 RPM, blue motor
4 3.25 inch wheels on either side, 1 more than the previous bot
This is to distribute the weight of our robot better, making it so that the robot sinks into the tiles a lot less
When the robot sinks into the tiles, it would be like driving uphill for the entire match
(draw diagram here)
Hopefully with this new setup, our drive will be more efficient, theoretically giving our robot more speed and torque (which will perform better)

We are also going to experiment with 2 new launching mechanisms:

Kicker: Show some examples of some bots that have both.
