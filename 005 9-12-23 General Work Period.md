Date: Dec 9 2023<br>
Logger: Yulian<br>
Witnesses: Henry, Eric<br>

Today we worked on the wings, intake, and cata.
We unfortunately did not have a file or a working drill so we had to make due and leave things for next time. 
#### Catapult
Sanded down the gear for the catapult for one tooth. <br>

The catapult now works fine <br>

#### Intake
I made another hole to add another arm to protect the sprocket for the motor<br>
The hole isnt the greatest so we will need to file it down on Tuesday<br>

#### FlyWheel
Also made a flywheel just for testing, bad build quality for now since it was done fast, only getting about 480 RPM out of 600 RPM. So instead of about 3000 RPM only 2520, will be redone and will have better RPM. 
Shots look ok for now<br>

We put a stand on it so we can test easier. <br>
