Date: Dec 9 2023<br>
Logger: Yulian<br>
Witnesses: Henry, Eric<br>

Today we worked on the wings, intake, and cata.
We unfortunately did not have a file or a working drill so we had to make due and leave things for next time. 
#### Catapult
Sanded down the gear for the catapult for one tooth. <br>

The catapult now works fine <br>

#### Intake
I made another hole to add another arm to protect the sprocket for the motor
The hole isnt the greatest so we will need to file it down on Tuesday
