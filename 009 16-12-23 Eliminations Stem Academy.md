### Finals Analysis for Stem Academy

We were 4th place, so we had choosing power.
3388A picked 3388H, 210T picked 210Z, we were considering between 2088S, 3300C, and 2088C.<br>
2088S was a generally pretty good bot.<br>
3300C was also pretty good.<br>
2088C (3388N) was a low bot with the potential to descore.<br>
Given that a good bot wouldn't win us champions, since we would be up against 3388A and 3388H, both better bots. We gambled on descoring with 2088C. (3388N)

#### Eliminations R16-1
![Match RF16-1](images/STEM%20Tournament/Match%20RF%2016-1.png)
#### Initial Thoughts
2088C was working on an autonomous for their robot, we didn't have time so we just used a simple push 1 triball auton. <br>
One team was a flywheel bot, the other a hero bot. We would block the flywheel bot, 2088C would matchload.
#### Game thoughts
We lost auton since 2088C crossed the auton line. Both alliances got to matchloading. 2088C cleared the opposing alliances net twice, but there weren't many triballs anyways.

#### Quarterfinals 4-1 Victory 114-79
![Match QF 4-1](images/STEM%20Tournament/Match%20QF%204-1.png)
#### Initial Thoughts
Same auton plan as last time, but 2088C made sure bot didn't cross auton line.<br>
The other team looked pretty good with 1 bot having descore potential, so we would need to be careful.
#### Game Thoughts 
2088C got to matchloading, we got to pushing 5760H off the matchload area. At some point while pushing them their brain turned off?<br>
![5760H turned off](images/STEM%20Tournament/5760H%20turned%20off.png)<br>
We may have accidentally turned them off, as we were pushing against their brain, but they turned back on. <br>
Both we and the opposing alliance double zoned at different points, but there was no descoring. 2088C didn't descore because they were matchloading and 5760A didn't because they were on the wrong side. <br>
Good Game

#### Semifinals 2-1 Victory x-x
![Match SF #2-1, 210T, 210Z 122 - 3388C, 2088C 69](images/STEM%20Tournament/Match%20SF%202-1.png)
#### Initial Thoughts
210s are generally pretty good, we would defend and 2088C would matchload. 2088C would hope for a moment to descore if possible.
#### Game thoughts
2088C matchloaded but was blocked by 210Z.<br>
210Ts bot turned off during the match, seems to be happening a lot? <br>
2088C's flywheel also broke during the match, so we had to matchload. <br>
We could have played better this match, we'll save it for later. GG 210T & 210Z.<br>
