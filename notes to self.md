thread locker is legal

wings intake blocker and high cata or kicker or flywheel (also being high is good)
if we want normal matches, try to be low (we need the threat of being able to descore triballs)
if we want to go for skills, doesnt matter

the ideal bot is a wings on both sides, high elevation kicker (which also climbs and blocks) with intake that somehow goes to kicker when kicker is down

I think that the notebook is good enough for now

To do for next time
-
- Double check wings and see how to make it stronger/more stable
- Add wings on other side
- Help with blocker
- Think about interviews
- Add backplate/pcb for wings
- Check up on catapult

To Do 
-
- PID and move to point
- Turn to degree
- CAD
- Notebook
